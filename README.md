## Start A Local Cluster

In theory we work with any recent version of openshift. In practice starting up openshift on your laptop can be a pain as [there are issues](https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/18596). So we test with OpenShift Online Pro SaaS at openshift.com which is where you can run a real business and use [minishift](https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html) locally. The latest minishift seen working is using `oc v3.11.0`.
